(1) As of December 25, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of the Company’s common
stock under the Program, announced on April 28, 2021, of which $274.5 billion had been utilized. The remaining
$40.5 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the Program as of December
25, 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program,
shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying
with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
(2) In November 2021, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”). Under the
terms of the agreements, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock
during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $6.0 billion. The total number of shares
ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based
on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in
the second quarter of 2022.
