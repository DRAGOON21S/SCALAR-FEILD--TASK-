Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Epic Games
Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the
“Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws
and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a
counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor
of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company
with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that
certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and
issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay
pending the appeal.
Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen
in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2022 that did
not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating
results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the
Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and
operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
